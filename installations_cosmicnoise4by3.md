# Cosmic Noise 4:3

<a href="https://vimeo.com/889453903/5fc3de61ea?share=copy"><strong><b>Cosmic Noise 4:3</b></strong></a>, Video Installation

A wall of discarded television sets, once throwing their poor images into countless living rooms, they are now tuned to a dead channel. An infite cosmos of black and white specs, framed by the very finite aspect ratio of 4:3.

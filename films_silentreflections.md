# Silent Reflections


<strong><b>Silent Reflections / Reflections on Silence #1</b></strong>, 2016, Video, colour, sound, 6min <br>

Silent reflections / Reflections on silence # 1 explores the urban lifeworld in an experimental-ethnographic style. It reflects the experiential condition of the metropolis with its fleeting visual and auditory complexity, fragmented in space and time. There is silence on the lips of the "travelers" through urban space, faces and bodies are like reflections, ghostly and unapproachable, the city made of electronic signals, shiny surfaces and rattling machines.

# Screenings

Ethnocineca, Austria<br>
Iowa City Documentary Film Festival (ICDOCS), USA<br>

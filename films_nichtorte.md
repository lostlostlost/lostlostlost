# Nicht-Orte. Eine Ethnologie der Einsamkeit

<strong><b>Nicht-Orte. Eine Ethnologie der Einsamkeit</b></strong>, 2015, Video, colour, German, 30min <br>

Non-places are spaces of solitude and busyness, anonymity and freedom, equality and the eternal encounter with the same. These spaces of supermodernity – train stations, airports, shopping centers – have become the condition of our everyday experience and manifest a new relation between us and the world. In contrast to anthropological places, these transitory, placeless places have no particular identity, no history and do not embody social relations. Inspired by the work of French anthropologist Marc Augé, the film roams through non-places in Vienna and relates them to Augé's text fragments.
